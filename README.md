# 🧠 LLM-Based Intelligent Software Development Tool

Welcome to the **LLM-Based Intelligent Software Development Tool**, a cutting-edge platform that integrates the power of **Streamlit** and **MetaGPT** to revolutionize the software engineering process. This tool covers the entire software development lifecycle, from project code generation to UML diagrams, defect detection, and documentation sharing.

## ✨ Features

### 🚀 Multi-Agent Based Project Code Generation
Effortlessly generate project code with the help of multi-agent collaboration. The intelligent agents analyze requirements and instantly provide you with complete codebases, dramatically accelerating your development process.

### 📊 Automatic UML and Class Diagram Generation
Visualize your software architecture with automatically generated **UML** and **Class Diagrams**. These visual aids help you and your team understand the structure and relationships within your project, enabling better design and communication.

### 🛡️ LLM-Based Code Defect Detection
Leverage advanced **LLM** capabilities to detect code defects. The tool performs in-depth analysis and points out potential issues in your code, ensuring higher quality and fewer bugs before release.

### ⚡ Async Processing with `asyncio`
Boost processing speed by utilizing **asyncio** for asynchronous handling. The platform processes multiple tasks in parallel, speeding up LLM responses and improving the overall efficiency of your development workflow.

### 🌐 GitHub Integration for Project Documentation Sharing
Easily link to your **GitHub repository** for seamless project documentation sharing. Provide your team and collaborators with direct access to your project's documentation, helping them quickly understand its scope, structure, and features.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Generate Code**: Use the multi-agent system to specify project requirements, and let the tool generate complete project code.
2. **Visualize Architecture**: Automatically create UML diagrams and class diagrams based on the generated or existing codebase.
3. **Detect Defects**: Run the LLM-based code defect detection to identify potential issues in your code.
4. **Optimize with Async Processing**: Improve performance by leveraging asynchronous operations for faster and more efficient LLM responses.
5. **Share Documentation**: Link your GitHub project repository for easy documentation sharing and project understanding.
